The paper for my bachelor's degree thesis, entitled: "Performance optimization in the context of highly scalable global APIs". 

It highlights and analyzes the aspects that need to be taken into consideration when developing a fast and reliable application meant for global usage. The focus is placed on the architectural patterns and performance optimization techniques that can be used to develop, deploy and test an efficient, resilient and highly scalable global API.

The other repositories in this account having the "coffee-" prefix were part of this project, and comprised two implementations of the same API, one using microservices and the other being a monolith.
